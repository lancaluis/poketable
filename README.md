## React Query DevTools

This project includes ReactQuery DevTools to help you simulate different states of the application:

- **Loading State:** You can trigger and observe the loading state to see how the application handles data fetching.
- **Error State:** You can simulate errors to test how the application responds to failures.

To access these features, use the palm tree icon located at the bottom right of the page.
